GitHub,"Create longest common subsequence.py

LCS Problem Statement: Given two sequences, find the length of longest subsequence present in both of them.
A subsequence is a sequence that appears in the same relative order, but not necessarily continious.
Example:""abc"", ""abg"" are subsequences of ""abcdefgh""."

This is for creating an algorithm implementing QuickSort Algorithm where the pivot element is chosen randomly between first and last elements of the array and the array elements are taken from a Standard Normal Distribution.

This is different from the ordinary quicksort in the sense, that it applies more to real life problems , where elements usually follow a normal distribution. Also the pivot is randomized to make it a more generic one."
